Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are an alternate way of estimating generative models via an adversarial process where a game theoretic approach is involved to learn to generate from the training distribution through minimax two-player game. As a part of my initial contributions to this project, I had also implemented a vanilla GAN to generate handwritten digits from a noisy latent space. Single image super-resolution (SISR) has been a notoriously challenging ill-posed problem, which aims to obtain a high-resolution output from one of its low-resolution versions. Despite the breakthroughs in accuracy and speed of SISR using faster and deeper convolutional neural networks (CNN), one central problem to recover the finer texture details super-resolving at large upscaling factors remains largely unsolved. With this motivation, I attempted to implement the idea proposed by [Christian Ledig et al.] to use a GAN comprising of deep convolutional networks for upscaling (4Ã— factor) natural images to produce the then state-of-the-art photo-realistic super-resolved images.
