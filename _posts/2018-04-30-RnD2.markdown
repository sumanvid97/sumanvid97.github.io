Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly become a methodology of choice for
analyzing medical images. I surveyed the use of deep learning for image classification, object detection, segmentation, and other tasks by extensively reading the relevant research papers. 

I critically reviewed and presented two important works: [classification of whole slide images] and [graph based pancreas segmentation in MRI scans]. 

[classification of whole slide images]: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192726
[graph based pancreas segmentation in MRI scans]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5223591/
