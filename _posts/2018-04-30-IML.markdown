The goal for this project is to explore the simple Q-learning technique and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to build a learned agent for the game that can play on it‚Äôs own for as long time as possible. Also, faster convergence is ensured for Q-learning by implementing ùúÄ-greedy policy & experience replay strategy
