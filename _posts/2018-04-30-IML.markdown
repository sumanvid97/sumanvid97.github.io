The goal for this project was to explore the simple Q-learning technique and [Deep Q-Network] (DQN) to train an environment agnostic agent for the game, that can play on it‚Äôs own, achieving super-human scores. Also, faster convergence was ensured by implementing ùúÄ-greedy & experience replay strategies.
