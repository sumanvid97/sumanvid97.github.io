**Hi, this website is currently outdated. Feel free to check out my most recent [CV].**

I am an MS student in Computer Science, [UMass Amherst]. My research interests lie in computer vision and machine learning. Currently, I'm working remotely with Prof. [Aniket Bera] ([GAMMA Lab], [UMD]) towards the goal of risk assessment for autonomous vehicles through ego-centric driving videos. 


Before this, I spent four wonderful years as an undergraduate student at [IIT Bombay]. For my thesis, I leveraged modern deep vision techniques for super resolution of the precipitation parameter over the Indian landmass. In the summer of 2019, I was fortunate to have interned at [Microsoft Research India]. I worked on devising state-space models for data-informed network simulation.

<!-- I maintain a record of my [research] and some [research implementations] under the respective tabs.  -->
