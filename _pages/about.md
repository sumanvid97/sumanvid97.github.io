I am Videsh, a senior undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor's degree from [Civil Engineering] at [IIT Bombay]. Over the last two years, I have developed a major interest in the field of Applied Machine Learning. 

I like solving inter-disciplinary research problems using Deep Learning methods, mainly relevant to Computer Vision, Climate Studies & Medical Imaging. Recently, I have also developed an interest for Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

Currently, I am working with professors [Amit Sethi] and [Subimal Ghosh] on statistical downscaling of rainfall projections for Indian landmass using deep CNNs.
