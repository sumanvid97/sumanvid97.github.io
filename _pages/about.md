I am Videsh, a senior undergraduate pursuing my Bachelor's degree from [Civil Engineering] at [IIT Bombay]. Over the last two years, I have developed a major interest in the field of Applied Machine Learning. 

I like solving inter-disciplinary research problems using Deep Learning methods, mainly relevant to Computer Vision, Climate Studies & Medical Imaging. Recently, I have also developed an interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

Currently, I am working with professors [Amit Sethi] and [Subimal Ghosh] on statistical downscaling of rainfall projections for Indian landmass using deep CNNs.

I have learnt a lot over my stay at IITB. In my initial years, I was actively involved in the proceedings of [Web n Coding Club] and [Mood Indigo]. Later, I slowly transitioned into the field of AI and Machine Learning through relevant coursework and [research] undertakings. My immediate goal is to pursue my master's degree in a related field, right after my undergrad.

For a full compilation of my projects, internships and achievements, do check out my [curriculum vitae].

Occasionally, I like to sketch or play the guitar. I consider myself an avid enthusiast of visual arts and music. Some of my favourite musical artists are Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, Queen, Hans Zimmer and AR Rahman. I am a fan of Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones and F.R.I.E.N.D.S.
